Retirement savings are substantial. Focus should be on increasing non-retirement savings and potentially optimizing expense categories.",
    "recommendations": "1. **Define Savings Goal:** Allocate a portion of the $800 net flow towards the computer purchase ($250/month needed for 6 months).\n2. **Expense Review:** Check subscriptions and grocery costs for potential savings.\n3. **Emergency Fund Top-up:** Consider adding $100-$150/month to emergency savings towards a 3-month goal (~$9600).\n4. **Consistency:** Automate savings transfers if possible.",
